This repository will include the implementation of EfficientNet on FER+ dataset [[1]](#1) using pytorch. **it's working now**

The FER+ annotations provide a set of new labels for the standard Emotion FER dataset [[2]](#2).

Since we can't host the actual image content, please find the original FER data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data).

this is the  baseline branch.
